## Description

The files contained in this repository were used to assist in finding $n$-page embeddings of graphs . The theorem it was used for appears in the article "On the Book Thickness of Total Graphs of Commutative Rings" which has the following abstract

 >Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring with non-zero unity. The total graph of $R$, $T_\Gamma(R)$, is the simple, undirected graph with all elements of $R$ as vertices and two vertices, $x$ and $y$, adjacent if $x + y$ is a zero divisor of $R$. We classify all of the rings whose total graphs have low book thickness. We then show that there are only a finite number of rings for arbitrarily large book thicknesses.

 The main result from the paper involves finding the book thickness of graphs that are induced from commutative rings. This code can serach for valid book embeddings for various $n$-books across the space of possible vertex spine orderings. Because the number of possible orderings grows at a factorial rate, this code only works well for graphs of 11 vertices or less. Book embeddings are found in a somewhat naive manner, and future work could be done to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. 

## Requirements

This project assumes you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) downloaded and installed on your local machine. Visit the downloads page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to find the latest release for Windows, macOS, or Linux. You can confirm that Python was correctly installed on your machine and is accesible globally by simply running the command `python` or `python3` on any terminal. If you believe Python is installed correctly but that is not working, it is likely that your path variable was not set up correctly. 

## Installation 

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the root of the cloned repository.

## Usage

Once all dependencies are downloaded and installed, you can run the Python scripts with the command `python main.py`.

## Contributions

This project was created and developed by [Luke Martin](https://github.com/lmartin5) as part of a research project in algebraic combinatorics. The research was conducted as part of an REU at Texas State University in the summer of 2022.

## Sources

The GeeksForGeeks article ["Python Program to print all permutations of a given string"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/) was vital for generating all possible vertex orderings.
