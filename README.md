## Description

The files contained in this repository were used to assist in finding $n$-page embeddings of graphs . The theorem appears in the article "On the Book Thickness of Total Graphs of Commutative Rings" which has the following abstract

 >Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring with non-zero unity. The total graph of $R$, $T_\Gamma(R)$, is the simple, undirected graph with all elements of $R$ as vertices and two vertices, $x$ and $y$, adjacent if $x + y$ is a zero divisor of $R$. We classify all of the rings whose total graphs have low book thickness. We then show that there are only a finite number of rings for arbitrarily large book thicknesses.

 The main result from the paper...

## Requirements

This project assumes you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) downloaded and installed on your local machine. Visit the downloads page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to find the latest release for Windows, macOS, or Linux. You can confirm that Python was correctly installed on your machine and is accesible globally by simply running the command `python` or `python3` on any terminal. If you believe Python is installed correctly but that is not working, it is likely that your path variable was not set up correctly. 

## Installation 

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the root of the cloned repository.

## Usage

Once all dependencies are downloaded and installed, you can run the Python scripts with the command `python main.py`.

## Contributions

This project was created and developed by [Luke Martin](https://github.com/lmartin5) as part of a research project in algebraic combinatorics. The research was conducted as part of an REU at Texas State University in the summer of 2022.

## Sources

The GeeksForGeeks article ["Python Program to print all permutations of a given string"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/) was vital for generating all possible vertex orderings.
