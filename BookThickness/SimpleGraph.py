@author lmartin5

This file contains the SimpleGraph class. It represents a simple 
graph (undirected edges, no loops, no multi-edges). Graphs are created 
with edge sets composed of natural number pairs. The highest number that appears
in the edge set is assumed to be the number of vertices, so for an 8 vertex graph
the highest number used in the edge set should be 8. It does not matter which order
the vertices are in the edge-tuples, but they will be rearranged to be ascending order
for ease in finding the book embedding of the graph.

ex.
edge_set = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)]
my_graph = SimpleGraph(edge_set)
